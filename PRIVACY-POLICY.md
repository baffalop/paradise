# Privacy Policy

We are not interested in your data, and we do not do deals with anyone who is.

_I Don't Know Where Paradise Is_ does not store or transmit personal information. It stores your currently generated playlist and play position locally on the device, nothing more.

It does not include any advertising. To the best of the developer's knowledge, none of the third party libraries used collect any data.
