  Some notes:
      * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
      * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
      * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
          * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

            This is a guided visit to a series of obliquely connected private libraries located in Amsterdam&rsquo;s Red Light District, the Stroud Green neighbourhood of London, Montreal&rsquo;s Plateau, and the 14e arrondissement of Paris. And other places.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be led through observations, reflections, and movements selected randomly from an evolving collection of objects in the libraries. The experience will last approximately sixty minutes. Please put on your headphones, turn off the ringer of your device, and when you are ready, swipe to the next screen to begin.
